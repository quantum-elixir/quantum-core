> **This README follows master, which may not be the currently published version**. Here are the
[docs for the latest published version of Quantum](https://hexdocs.pm/quantum/readme.html).

## Setup

To use Quantum in your project, edit the `mix.exs` file and add Quantum to

**1. the list of dependencies:**
```elixir
defp deps do
  [{:quantum, ">= 2.2.0"},
   {:timex, "~> 3.0"}]
end
```

**2. and create a scheduler for your app:**
```elixir
defmodule YourApp.Scheduler do
  use Quantum.Scheduler,
    otp_app: :your_app
end
```

**3. and your application's supervision tree:**
```elixir
defmodule YourApp.Application do
  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    import Supervisor.Spec, warn: false

    children = [
      # This is the new line
      worker(YourApp.Scheduler, [])
    ]

    opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: YourApp.Supervisor]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
  end
end
```

## Migrate to V2

See the [Migration Guide](https://hexdocs.pm/quantum/migrate-v2.html).

## Usage

Configure your cronjobs in your `config/config.exs` like this:

```elixir
config :your_app, YourApp.Scheduler,
  jobs: [
    # Every minute
    {"* * * * *",      {Heartbeat, :send, []}},
    # Every 15 minutes
    {"*/15 * * * *",   fn -> System.cmd("rm", ["/tmp/tmp_"]) end},
    # Runs on 18, 20, 22, 0, 2, 4, 6:
    {"0 18-6/2 * * *", fn -> :mnesia.backup('/var/backup/mnesia') end},
    # Runs every midnight:
    {"@daily",         {Backup, :backup, []}}
  ]
```

More details on the usage can be found in the [Documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/quantum/configuration.html)
