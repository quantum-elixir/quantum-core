# Crontab format

## Basics

| Field        | Allowed values                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| second       | 0-59                                        |
| minute       | 0-59                                        |
| hour         | 0-23                                        |
| day of month | 1-31                                        |
| month        | 1-12 (or names)                             |
| day of week  | 0-6 (0 is Sunday, or use abbreviated names) |

The `second` field can only be used in extended Cron expressions.

Names can also be used for the `month` and `day of week` fields.
Use the first three letters of the particular day or month (case does not matter).

## Special expressions

Instead of the first five fields, one of these special strings may be used:

| String      | Description                                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@annually` | Run once a year, same as `~e["0 0 1 1 *"]` or `@yearly`   |
| `@daily`    | Run once a day, same as `~e["0 0 * * *"]` or `@midnight`  |
| `@hourly`   | Run once an hour, same as `~e["0 * * * *"]`               |
| `@midnight` | Run once a day, same as `~e["0 0 * * *"]` or `@daily`     |
| `@minutely` | Run once a minute, same as `~e["* * * * *"]`              |
| `@monthly`  | Run once a month, same as `~e["0 0 1 * *"]`               |
| `@reboot`   | Run once, at startup                                      |
| `@secondly` | Run once a second, same as `~e["* * * * * *"]e`           |
| `@weekly`   | Run once a week, same as `~e["0 0 * * 0"]`                |

## Crontab Dependency

All Cron Expressions are parsed and evaluated by [crontab](https://hex.pm/packages/crontab).
